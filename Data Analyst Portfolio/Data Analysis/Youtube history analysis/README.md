## Understanding the data:

What data fields are available in the YouTube watch history JSON file?
What is the range of dates for the watch history?
What kind of information does each entry in the watch history contain?
Are there additional fields in the search history JSON file compared to the watch history JSON file, or vice versa?
Can you map entries in the search history to entries in the watch history (i.e., can you determine if a search led to a video watch)?

## Data Cleaning:

How can you convert the JSON file into a suitable format for analysis (like a pandas DataFrame)?
Are there any missing or inconsistent data fields that need to be handled?
Do you need to convert any data types (e.g., dates to datetime format, duration to seconds, etc.)?
How can you merge or link the two datasets in a meaningful way for your analysis?
Are there any missing or inconsistent data fields that need to be handled in either of the datasets?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

What is the distribution of watch times (e.g., What times of day do you most often watch YouTube? On what days of the week?)?
How has your YouTube usage changed over time (e.g., Are you watching more or fewer videos now than in the past?)?
What are the most common channels you watch?
What are the most common video categories (if this data is available) you watch?
What are the most common search terms you use on YouTube?
How often does a search lead to a video watch?
What is the time gap between a search and a related video watch?

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK:

What are the most common words in the titles of the videos you watch?
Can you classify the titles into different topics using NLP techniques (like topic modeling)?
Can you analyze the sentiments of the video titles? Does it have any correlation with your watch time or watch frequency?
What are the most common words in your search terms?
Can you classify the search terms into different topics using NLP techniques?
Can you analyze the sentiments of the search terms and compare it with the sentiments of the video titles?

## Further Analysis:

Are there any trends or patterns in the types of videos you watch (e.g., Do you watch more educational content during weekdays and more entertainment content during weekends?)?
Are there any patterns or correlations between video lengths and the frequency of your views?
Can you predict future watching habits based on your historical search and watch data?

## Data Visualization:

Can you create visualizations (like bar charts, line graphs, word clouds, etc.) to better understand your data and share your findings?
